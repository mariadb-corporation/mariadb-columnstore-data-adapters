Follow this steps to build the plugin from source.

### Requirements
These requirements need to be installed prior building:
* MariaDB AX [Bulk Data Adapter build dependencies](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-columnstore-api/blob/master/README.md) 
* chrpath (sudo apt-get install chrpath || sudo yum install chrpath)

### Build process
To build the plugin from source execute following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-columnstore-data-adapters.git
cd mariadb-columnstore-data-adapters/kettle-columnstore-bulk-exporter-plugin
./gradlew plugin
```
The built plugin can be found in _build/distributions/_

## Installation of the plugin in PDI / Kettle
Following steps are necessary to install the ColumnStore bulk loader plugin.
1. build the plugin from source or download it from our [website](https://mariadb.com/downloads/mariadb-ax/data-adapters)
2. extract the archive _kettle-columnstore-bulk-exporter-plugin-*.zip_ into your PDI installation directory _$PDI-INSTALLATION/plugins_.
3. copy [MariaDB's JDBC Client](https://mariadb.com/downloads/mariadb-ax/connector) _mariadb-java-client-2.2.x.jar_ into PDI's lib directory _$PDI-INSTALLATION/lib_.
4. install the additional library dependencies

### Ubuntu dependencies
```shell
sudo apt-get install libuv1
```

### CentOS dependencies
```shell
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install libuv
```

## Configuration
By default the plugin tries to use ColumnStore's default configuration _/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/etc/Columnstore.xml_ to connect to the ColumnStore instance through the Bulk Write SDK.

Individual configurations can be assigned within each block.

Information on how to change the _Columnstore.xml_ configuration file to connect to remote ColumnStore instances can be found in our  [Knowledge Base](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/columnstore-bulk-write-sdk/#environment-configuration).

## Testing
To test the plugin you can execute the job _test.kjb_ from the _test_ directory. 

You might have to change the JDBC configuration in _test.kjb_, _export-to-mariadb.ktr_ and _export-to-csv.ktr_ to match your ColumnStore installation. 

## Limitations
The plugin currently can't handle blob datatypes and only supports multi inputs to one block if the input field names are equal for all input sources.
